# ClientLoginWebApp

This is my first NodeJS and ExpressJS web app! I have implemented my own server which allows for a user to register for an account, login to their account, view their dashboard, and logout. Each one of these steps has the correct user input validation procedures in place, and is connected to my personal AWS database to store user data.
